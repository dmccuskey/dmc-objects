# Examples Overview #


* **Corona-Graphics-Fishies**

	This is a conversion of the example `Graphics/Fishies` which comes with Corona SDK.

	_Care was taken to retain the variable names and logic so that it would be easier to see how the code for `Fishies` was split up to become object-oriented._

* **Corona-Physics-ManyCrates**

	This is a conversion of the example `Physics/ManyCrates` which comes with Corona SDK.

	_Care was taken to retain the variable names and logic so that it would be easier to see how the code for `ManyCrates` was split up to become object-oriented._

* **DMC-MultiShapes**

	Press the button and shapes get drawn and placed randomly on the display using the Corona drawing primitives.

	_This example shows multi-level single-inheritance, simple use of the `dmc_buttons` lib, and use of the Factory Pattern for object creation._

* **DMC-ufo**

	UFOs fly randomly around the screen. They turn different colors depending on their speed - the faster they go, the "hotter" the ship's material becomes.

	_This is a simple, but complete example of using `dmc_objects`._
